Research Description

Strategies based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI have emerged in computing aiming to promote a better understanding of predictions made by computational models like a black box. Most of today’s XAI-based tools explain these types of models, generating rankings of attributes aimed at explaining the same, that is, analysis of Attribute Relevance. On the other hand, there are metrics aimed at improving the model’s performance, such as the Gain of
Information, for example, which also generates a ranking of attributes, but related to the Importance of Attributes, exclusively focused on performance. This research carried out analyzes with five datasets of different complexities, selected by Item Response Theory - IRT, creating computational models based on four tree-based algorithms, to compare how the Importance and Relevance rankings of Attributes are related to the classification performance of each model.
In all, twenty computational models were generated, and the results prove the existence of a significant influence of performance on all XAI metrics analyzed here. Also showing that Importance and Relevance of attributes are two metrics that go together, since the better the performance of the model the better its explainability.
